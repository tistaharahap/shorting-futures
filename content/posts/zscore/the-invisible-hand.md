Is it God? I hope not, because explaining faith is exponentially more difficult. I can assure the fingerprints of humans are there to be seen, not God's.

Let's step back and give appreciation to the coin that started this journey: Bitcoin. It's the the firstborn and the ugly duckling, the most energy intensive coin in the world. Since its creation though, Bitcoin stood against every manner of depreciation and appreciation. It's the true north star for altcoins.

## Bitcoin Spot VS Altcoin Futures

In this section let's revisit `REEFUSDT` and this time let's pit it against `BTCUSDT`.

![BTC VS REEF](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/r/RyeQRy9h.png)

The chart suggest that while `BTCUSDT` is trending down from hour 6-14, on the contrary `REEFUSDT` was trending up. The more `BTCUSDT` fell, the more the gain upwards for `REEFUSDT`. Continued by `BTCUSDT`'s recovery and its trajectory reversed to the upside at hour 14-15, `REEFUSDT` pumped even more resulting in a pump candle size larger than any of the previous pumps. For the next chart, let's see if we change instead of using `REEFUSDT`'s spot pair for the Spot VS Futures Zscore indicator, let's use `BTCUSDT` spot.

The chart above clearly tells us we haven't gotten any shorting opportunity yet. The Zscore hasn't even crossed `1.69` yet although the price of `REEFUSDT` has pumped significantly. That's why we're only seeing corrections, we haven't seen a dump as massive as its pump. The smart move according to this chart is to **WAIT**. Let's scroll to the left and see the history if we ever get a shorting opportunity in other times.

![The History](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/w/WsNzXgbb.png)

Power moves are consistent with our past learnings:

* Futures prices dwarfed by spot prices peaks
* The dump after the pump always happens
* The dump usually happens after Zscores are over `1.69`

On the second pump, the green pump candle's Zscore was at `4.01` signifying that this is massive outlier. We haven't seen values like that in the recent history of `REEFUSDT`. But for both pumps, when do we short? We short **near the peak of the short squeeze.**

There are times when the short squeeze will only create a shallow peak which is evident in the second pump. This makes sense because of the selling pressure as a result of spot holders hedging short in the futures market. There's no way the futures market can break through the wall, not enough liquidity? Let's prove that.

## Open Interest

Open Interest is in short is the aggregate value of the position sizes of futures traders. This article excerpted below explains Open Interest as a whole, [link â†’](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/futures/what-information-does-open-interest-convey-421499824684900398).

> Open interest indicates capital flowing in and out of the market. As capital flows into a futures contract, open interest increases. Conversely, as capital flows out of the derivatives markets, open interest declines. For this reason, increasing open interest is often considered as one of the many factors that can serve as confirmation of a bull market, whereas decreasing open interest signals a bear market.

Take it with a pinch of salt. Although Binance seems to want to educate traders, don't forget that Binance itself knows all of our positions in aggregate at the very least. There's no regulation (yet, never I hope), anything can happen.

For us, let's try to understand how Open Interest can fit in into our chart and see what it tells us.

![REEFUSDT Open Interest](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/y/YYe8l8qa.png)

The low is at `11.32mio` while the peak is at `27.25mio`. At its peak, `REEFUSDT` attracted almost 3x value in Open Interest. Is this not enough liquidity? We have to understand that those are leveraged number. For a 20x leverage, the peak is worth `1.3mio`. Now let's see the spot volume.

![REEFUSDT Volume](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/x/XHlfxdyS.png)

At the peak of the pump, that candle's volume was `2.65bio` in `REEF` which translates to `15.1mio` in `USDT` calculated by multiplying volume with the median price of the candle. With this we can prove that there is not enough liquidity in the futures market to fight against spot's volume. This also confirms that the main drive for the movement is the spot market.

Assuming that the futures market is using 20x leverage, that's more than 10x the difference in liquidity between spot versus futures. This is an important finding as this further corraborate all of the other findings mainly:

* Look to the spot market for signals
* Short the short squeeze whenever unless you're brave enough to short at the top
* Only trade when there's volitility, avoid sideways movements at all costs

Let's look once again how the trading setup looks like so far and annotate with where our positions would look like.

![The setup](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/3/3IiL3k4W.png)

I would say that's the conservative setup that would most likely apply in 9 out 10 situations. Focusing just on these 2 setups, in the span of ~3 days, we got 2 entries with significant profits. If you just have 1 position with isolated margin of 20x, you don't need to trade anymore that week. You have just produced a **7x** return in just 3 days.

Our entries are based on the following:

* Z Score is offside above `1.69`
* MAD - Score Spot is offside above `1.69`
* Open Interest is peaking
* Short squeeze is happening or has happened
