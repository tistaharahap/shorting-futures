As most people already know, buying low and selling high is evident since the first humans gives value to their interest. In the 1980s after gold lost its place as the reserve for the last western superpower, the stock market flew like a rocket launching to the moon. We have had several crashes since then but the central banks are always there to print more fiat money to throw into the hands of the big banks to prop up prices. As recent as March 2020 when the pandemic conveniently crashes the market, it's followed by periods of Quantitative Easing (QE) or printing money in layman's terms.

The previous paragraph highlights 40 years of market behaviour, to hodl in the hopes of gaining value in the future. There are plenty of successful examples, nowadays we can highlight tech companies or FAANG. People who bought stocks when the companies first went IPO have their net worth appreciated. The question is, who's paying for all that gain? After all, it's a zero sum game.

New blood is the answer. People who bought high in the hopes of gaining appreciation in the futures. It's a ponzi, say it like it is. Other than the lucky few individuals who bought low, who bought low with the most volume? You guessed it, it's the market maker!

In the stock market, the true market makers is an elite club of just a few makers. Who are they? The video below will give some insights.

CZ and his exchange Binance came from Wall Street. CZ used to create software for market making for these people. When Binance came into existence, crypto was exponentially wilder than it is right now. It's common to see ICOs raising hundreds of millions of dollars to runaway with the proceeds. What CZ did was to eradicate these outliers and place a system where his knowledge of Wall Street made crypto to become a well oiled liquidity mining venue. Especially true since Bitcoin's meteoric rise in 2021 as more new blood entered the market.

These new blood who entered the market came with a mindset of hodl coming from a prevalent mindset from the stock market. Most of these people bought somewhere at the top and told themselves it's ok to DCA the drop. They are the product of pump and dump, the product of Binance. No other global crypto exchange is as big as Binance, at least none with the breadth and width of Binance's offerrings, NONE. Binance's selling point is liquidity and that's true.

## What Is Market Making?

At its simplest meaning, it's buying low and selling high as explained in the video in the previous section. Nowadays though, crypto is different, it's live 24/7/365, the first of its kind. Having a market that's always on means it's not feasible to have humans trade on it all the time. Same can be said for the stock market of course with limited market active times. The point is, robots are trading, not humans.

The lowest risk would be arbitrage trading. A [simple triangular arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triangulararbitrage.asp) is a money making machine like no other. In an inefficient exchange, making money through arbitrage is easily done with robots. However in bigger exhanges where more robots are in effect, it's harder to do. The rise of Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is something else though, I recommend you to read about [Ethereum's Dark Forest](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest).

In crypto, the most interesting type of market making for pump and dump is an arbitrage between spot and futures markets. Make the pump in the spot market and dump it in the futures market.

In that chart, the candles are Binance futures candles. The overlaid blue borders are from its spot counterpart. Notice that the blue highs are often higher than the futures market? Especially at its peak! For market makers this is called a `Spot Perpetual Arbitrage`. In Binance, the spot market for alts are usually lower volume, when a sudden upwards movement happen, various robots bought the pump trigerring other robots and so the snowball fall. At the same robots are hedging their buys with a short at the futures market. That's why the futures market can't go as high as the spot market.

Any market maker can instigate the pump, they just have to have enough capital to trigger the other robots to follow through. No one can predict a pump unless you have insider's info. On the bright side, anyone can detect a pump just by looking at the chart. The problem with just looking at the chart is to determine if a pump is still happening or it has died out.

In this documentation, we'll try to reverse engineer the market and follow smart money.
